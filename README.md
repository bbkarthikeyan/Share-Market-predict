# Share-Market-predict
It analyzes the curent trend and past trends of share Market and based on machine learning(Linear regression,logistic regression,SVR) and deep earning learning algorithm(LSTM)
Impact of many factors on the stock prices makes the stock prediction a difficult and highly complicated task. In this paper, machine learning techniques have been applied for the stockprice prediction in order to overcome such difficulties. In the implemented work, five models have been developed and their performances are compared in predicting the stock market trends.These models are based on supervised learning techniques i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM),Logistic regression.The experimental results show that LSTM algorithm performs the best for large datasets and Linear regression is the best for small datasets. The results also reveal that reduction in the number of technical indicators reduces the accuracies of each algorithm.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

The hardware requirements may serve as the basis for a contract for the implementation of the system and should therefore be a complete and consistent specification of the whole system. They are used by software engineers as the starting point for the system design. It shows what the system does and not how it should be implemented

PROCESSOR		:  	Intel I5
RAM			:	4GB 
HARD DISK 		:	40 GB

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

The software requirements document is the specification of the system. It should include both a definition and a specification of requirements. It is a set of what the system should do rather than how it should do it. The software requirements provide a basis for creating the software requirements specification.  It is useful in estimating cost, planning team activities, performing tasks and tracking the team’s and tracking the team’s progress throughout the development activity.
